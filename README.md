## About

This project demonstrates the use of .NET MAUI to build cross-platform applications for iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS. The project includes multiple sample features and UI components to practice developing responsive and adaptive layouts, as well as handling platform-specific features.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET MAUI**: A cross-platform framework for building native apps with C# and XAML.
- **C#**: The main programming language used in this project.
- **XAML**: Used for designing user interfaces.
- **SQLite**: For local data storage (if applicable).
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Pattern used for clean separation of concerns.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Visual Studio 2022 (with .NET MAUI workload installed)
- Android/iOS Emulator (for testing cross-platform apps)
- Optional: Xcode (for macOS/iOS development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zainulabdeenoffical/dotnet-maui-practice.git
    cd dotnet-maui-practice
    ```

2. Open the project in **Visual Studio 2022**:
   - Launch Visual Studio and select `Open a project or solution`, then navigate to the project directory.

3. Build the project:
   - In Visual Studio, choose the platform you want to run (e.g., Android, iOS, Windows).
   - Build the project using the "Build" option or press `Ctrl+Shift+B`.

4. Run the project:
   - Select an emulator or connected device from the toolbar and press `F5` or click "Start" to run the application.

## Features

- Multi-platform support: Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS.
- Sample views and layouts to demonstrate responsive design.
- Platform-specific services (e.g., GPS, Camera, Notifications).
- SQLite database integration for offline data storage.
- Simple MVVM pattern implementation.
- Custom themes and UI components.

## Usage

This project can be used as a template or practice environment to:
- Explore cross-platform UI elements.
- Experiment with platform-specific APIs in .NET MAUI.
- Build and test responsive layouts for different screen sizes.
- Understand the basics of MVVM architecture in MAUI.
- Implement basic CRUD operations with SQLite.

### Running on Different Platforms

- **Android**: You can test on an Android emulator or connected Android device.
- **iOS**: If you're on macOS, you can run the project on an iOS simulator or connected iOS device (Xcode required).
- **Windows**: Run the app directly as a native Windows application.
- **macOS**: Run natively on macOS (requires macOS host).
